# Project-G
Project-G is a personal 2D game project that I am creating alone to both practice C# as well as begin learning the game design process.
## Gameplay
Project-G features a combined Portal/Celeste feel. The player begins by the player becoming lost in an unknown location deep underground. The player then begins attempting to escape when he comes across a grappling hook. This grappling hook, however, comes with a few stipulations. The hook can only be used once in succession. The player regenerates their usage by touching the ground, dying, or gathering a recharge. The hook allows the player to pull themselves into an object as well as fling themselves by conserving momentum. The player must traverse the cave in hopes of escaping while avoiding the dangers along the way. However, the player soon finds out that he may not be the only one inside the cave...
